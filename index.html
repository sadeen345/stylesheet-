    <mark>COVID-19</mark> (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is a viral disease.
         The virus that causes it is called severe acute respiratory syndrome
          coronavirus 2.It is more commonly known as SARS-CoV-2. It began
         spreading in late 2019 and became a pandemic in 2020.
         <br>
          Symptoms<b>
         <br>
        The typical symptoms of COVID-19 often appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus.<br>
        <br>
         Symptoms can include:<b>
        <br>
    * Dry cough<br>
      *Shortness of breath.<br>
 * Loss of taste or smell.<br>
* Extreme fatigue or exhaustion.<br>
 * Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting, or loose stools (diarrhea).<br>
* Pain, such as headache, body aches, or muscle aches
         Fever or chills.<br>
 * Fluid-like symptoms, such as congestion, runny nose, or sore throat.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<br><h1>When to see a doctor</h1></br>
<p>Contact your healthcare professional if you test positive for COVID-19. If you have
     symptoms of COVID-19 and need to be tested, or if you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, your healthcare
      professional can help.
      People at high risk of severe illness may be given medications to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Or,
       your healthcare team may plan regular tests to monitor your health.</p>
       <br>
       <h1 style="font-size:40px;"> Get immediate emergency medical help for any of the following symptoms:</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
      * Difficulty or trouble breathing.<br>
      *Change in skin, lips, or nail beds to pale, gray, or blue.<br>
      *New-onset confusion.<br>
      *Difficulty waking up or staying awake.<br>
      *Persistent chest pain or pressure.<br>
<h1 style="font-size:40px;">Reasons</h1>
<mark> <b>is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as SARS-CoV-2.
Coronavirus spreads primarily through person-to-person contact and can be transmitted from an infected person who has no
 symptoms. When COVID-19 patients cough, sneeze, breathe, sing, or talk, their breath may be contaminated with COVID-19.</b></mark>
 <p>The respiratory-transmitted coronavirus can land directly on the face of a nearby person after a sneeze or cough, for example.
  Other people can inhale the droplets or particles exhaled by infected people if they are close together or in an area with
   poor airflow. A person may touch a surface with infected respiratory droplets and then touch their face with their hand that
    has the coronavirus on it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">
  * Over time, the body's defense against COVID-19 can weaken.<br>

*A person may be exposed to so much virus that it overwhelms their immune defenses.<br>

*The virus replicates itself as it spreads through a population. During this process,
 the genetic code may randomly change in each copy. These changes are called mutations.
  If the virus that causes COVID-19 changes in ways that reduce
 the effectiveness of immunity resulting from previous infection or vaccination, recurrence of the disease is possible.<br>
